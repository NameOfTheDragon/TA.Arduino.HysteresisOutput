    "description": "Accepts an input state and produces an output action which guarantees minimum stable on and off times. That is, once the output changes state, that state is latched for a minimum period. Example application: Given a rain detector that generates a pulse whenever a raindrop is detected, we might wish to produce an output that is latched on for several minutes from the last rain drop detection.",
